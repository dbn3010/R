<p>Retail industry is one among the core industries which involves the process of selling consumable goods to the purchaser and generating revenue out of this process. It involves both online and offline market for the business. In this digital world, as the businesses are growing, so do the data. Several strategies are not being implemented to maximize the output such as market analysis, customer analysis, production and distribution channels reviews etc. Part of data collection, transaction data is very crucial for companies involved in this industry to analyze it and use the gained insights for their benefits in business growth <i>(References: Kimberly, 2020).</i>

<p>Retail data analytics is now a driving force in this industry by collecting and analyzing the sales data to uncover hidden patterns and trends to gain more insights about the performance of specific department, stores, customers and vendors. By performing effective analysis, we can use to insights to improve and optimize pricing, help retaining customer loyalty by addressing their needs timely, by recommending products of their interests based on their purchase history to keep them attracted and also to implement new solutions where existing process is lacking.<i>(Referenced from Ron, 2019 and Alexandra, 2021)</i>

<p>As a sales analyst, I will be analyzing the available data set <mark>Project6Data.xlsx</mark> which lists the details about the global sales history of consumer, corporate and home office products for the year 2020. This data contains categorical variables such as product names, its department and division, global market and regions etc. It also incorporates numerical variables as total sales, product price, discount, losses, profits etc. This data set holds <i>1000</i> sales records corresponding to <i>27</i> variables.

<p>Through the available data set, we would be trying to look through the major loss and profit points in across multiple divisions. For this, we will be using R to analyze the data set and plot the figures accordingly to summarize our study.

<P><BR><FONT SIZE=5, COLOR="#17139B"><B>CONCLUSION</B></FONT><BR><P>

- From the above analysis, we have analyzed and presented the basic descriptive statistics including the mean, median, standard deviation and range of the given numerical variables.
- We also presented the sales frequency of different global markets where we got to know that Asia Pacific was having the highest sales records compared to Africa which was having the lowest sales records.<P>
- Bar chart and pie chart are commonly being used for presenting the categorical variable frequencies. However, it is comparatively difficult to analyze the difference in pie chart if labels are not present.<P>
- Comparing the box plot and histogram, provides a better visual explanations as how the data spread is happening for numerical variables.<P>
- From plot 6, we got to know that sales records for furniture products is comparably higher than other departments across the globe whereas office supplies are among the least sold products.<P>
- As per the plot 8, home office products are having least sales, however, considering the COVID-19 pandemic situation, subsequent year sales data might see increase in this segment due to work from home norm.<P>
- Box plots are considered to be the best graph to represent the value distribution among the categorical variables. From Plot 9, we can see the profit distribution across each global market with their value percentages comparison.<P>
- From plot 10, we have gained the knowledge about which product division is experiencing the most and the least losses which is happening as a result of return of the defective products.<P>
- Plot 12 provides us the idea of which product segment is having the highest and the lowest shipping cost in Western US region. In this case, corporate segment is having the highest shipping cost compared to the home office products which are the least ones.<P>
- After analyzing the above data, we have found that even though sales records are higher in USCA market than African market, its average profit value is lower than that of African market. Upon exploring more, we can see that average profit of office supplies department is much higher than average profits from office supplies in USCA market.<P>
- It can be noted that, as most of the losses are recorded for the furniture items, users must have returned these products as they have found some defects in it which could have happened considering several reasons like poor quality materials or bad shipping and handling of products.<P>
- Through this project, I have learned to read the data set effectively and make observations from different sections using categorical and numerical variables.<P>
- I have also gathered the knowledge to slice the data set and compare the numerical variables to the categorical variables and plot them using appropriate graphs.<P>
